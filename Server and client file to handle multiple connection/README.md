--Information and Explanation--

We create a socket and binding it to Host and port

Then we are accepting multiple client and storing conn(object) and address of various client in list of all_connection[] and all_address[]

Now, our Shell is started , we named it as turtle

Now you can type 'list' (without quote) which will print of all client connected with your server

Now, you can select any one by typing 'select _' (without quote and in place of _ write id no. of client whom you want to proceed further)

Now you can run any valid command to selected client

If you want to work with other client pass command quit

Now again use list command and view your client and select your client by id no.

if you want to close turtle pass command over
